          <h3>Car Details</h3>
          <p> With its distinctive olive-forked front end, this car is instantly recognizable.  Although good luck finding one as they are rather rare.  This larger than life car is not quite the size of a submarine, but it sure packs a punch like one!</p>
          <p>We’re working thru the final stages of a frame-off restoration on this barn find, and we hope to have it done in the next 3-6 months.  Although we are eager, we never rush!  Patience is a virtue, and we’ve been thru too much with this car already to have it anything less than perfect when it’s done!  At the moment, we are installing MSD electronic distributor, carburetor, and exhaust headers.  Engine bay wiring also needs to be completed, then it’s off for final sanding and beautiful yellow paint!  More pictures coming soon, so stay tuned!</p>
